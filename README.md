# Country Calgary FM

Welcome to Country Calgary FM! This is a simple web application designed for you to listen to the best country music stations from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, directly from your browser.

## üìª How It Works

This application is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does not require complex installation.

1.  **Open the Application:** Simply open the `fm_calgari.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2.  **Select a Station:** Use the dropdown menu to choose the radio station you wish to listen to.

3.  **Enjoy!**

## üéß Important Notes on Playback:

* **Stream Loading (Patience, please):** When selecting a station, please **wait a few seconds** for the audio stream or embedded player to load. Loading speed may depend on your internet connection and the station's server.

* **Stations with Internal Players (e.g., WILD 95.3, Virgin Radio, Moose FM):** Some stations use their own web players (which load within the application). For these stations, you might need to **manually click the "Play" button that appears inside the player** once it has loaded. This is normal browser behavior to prevent autoplay without user interaction.

* **Direct Stream Stations:** Other stations will play directly using the browser's native audio controls. If autoplay does not start, simply click the "Play" button on the controls that appear.
